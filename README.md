# Order Data Analysis  

This project involves analyzing order data to uncover valuable insights into sales trends, product performance, and regional preferences. The dataset was extracted using Kaggle API, cleaned and transformed using Python (pandas), and loaded into a PostgreSQL database for further analysis.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Preparation**:  
  - Extracted the dataset using Kaggle API.  
  - Cleaned and transformed raw data using pandas.  
  - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.  

- **Database Integration**:  
  - Loaded the cleaned data into PostgreSQL for structured analysis.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Identified top-performing products by revenue and sales.  
  - Highlighted regional bestsellers and their sales distribution.  
  - Compared month-over-month growth in sales for 2022 and 2023.  
  - Determined peak sales months for different product categories.  
  - Analyzed subcategories with the highest growth in profit.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Libraries**: pandas, psycopg2, matplotlib, seaborn  

## Insights  
This analysis provided actionable insights into sales performance, product demand, and regional preferences. The findings can support data-driven decisions in inventory management, marketing, and supply chain optimization.  

## Next Steps  
- Visualize key insights using Tableau or Power BI for enhanced storytelling.  
- Automate the process using Python scripts to streamline data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
